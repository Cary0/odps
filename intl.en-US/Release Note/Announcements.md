This topic lists updates to MaxCompute in descending chronological order.

## August 29, 2019 \(Beijing time\): External table is upgraded. {#section_2o4_6os_7t5 .section}

An upgrade will be carried out on MaxCompute at 14:00-23:00, 29 August 2019 \(Beijing time\). During this upgrade, when you use external table custom storage handler to implement the outputer interface, the job may fail if column data is obtained through column names rather than digital subscriptions.

Regions: Asia Pacific SE 1, West USA 1

## August 21, 2019 \(Beijing time\): External table is upgraded. {#section_ar1_3mj_o5s .section}

An upgrade will be carried out on MaxCompute at 14:00-23:00, 21 August 2019 \(Beijing time\). During this upgrade, when you use external table custom storage handler to implement the outputer interface, the job may fail if column data is obtained through column names rather than digital subscriptions.

Regions: Asia Pacific NE 1, Central Europe 1, China\(Hong Kong\), Asia Pacific SE 2

The details are as follows: The record passed in `Outputer. output (Record record)` is the record generated by the last operator of Outputer. The column name may change, and the system cannot guarantee the fixed column name. For example, the column name generated by the expression `some_function (column_a)` is a temporary column name, so the use of `record. get (column name)` to obtain column content may be affected. You may use `record. get (index)` instead. To get the column name of the table in Outputer, please call `DataAttributes. getFullTableColumns ()`.

For any questions, you can submit the ticket to contact us.

## July 24, 2019\(Beijing time\): MaxCompute Spark is released. {#section_gc6_8fv_pmy .section}

Region: West USA 1, China\(Hong Kong\), Central Europe 1, Asia Pacific SE 1, Asia Pacific SOU 1.

## March 26, 2019: MaxCompute SQL is upgraded. {#section_k47_949_7fl .section}

-   The `GROUPING SETS` clause \(together with the `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` subclauses\) can be used to aggregate and analyze data of multiple dimensions. For more information, see [Grouping Sets](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/SQL/Select Operation/Grouping Sets.md#).
-   The `INTERSECT`, `MINUS`, and `EXCEPT` clauses gained support. For more information, see [UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/SQL/Select Operation/UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.md#).
-   When the system reads files in ORC or Parquet format by using external tables, it can crop the columns in the files, which can reduce I/O and resource usage, thereby lowering overall computing costs.
-   Systems that run in the Java UDX framework are enhanced to support writable parameters. For more information, see [Java UDF](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/SQL/UDF/Java UDF.md#).

## January 15, 2019: The underlying structure of MaxCompute in China \(Hong Kong\) is optimized from 16:00 to 20:00. {#section_808_oro_qmg .section}

The underlying metadata warehouse of MaxCompute in China \(Hong Kong\) is optimized from 16:00 to 20:00 on January 15, 2019 to improve the performance and stability of MaxCompute. During the release window, users in the **Hong Kong** region may encounter submission delays or failures for tasks, which may last about **one minute**. In the worst cases, the application may be **unavailable for 30 minutes** \(or half an hour\). Therefore, we recommend that you do not submit any tasks during the release window. If you have any questions, contact us through DingTalk or by opening a ticket. Users in other regions are not affected.

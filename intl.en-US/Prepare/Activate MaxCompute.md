# Activate MaxCompute

If you are using DTplus products and DataWorks for the first time, you must log on to the console by using your Alibaba Cloud account. If you need to log on to the console and create projects as a RAM user, you must ensure that the RAM user has been granted the required permissions according to [Create an Alibaba Cloud account](/intl.en-US/Prepare/Create an Alibaba Cloud account.md). To activate MaxCompute, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud website](https://www.alibabacloud.com/zh) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  Go to the home page of [MaxCompute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/maxcompute) and click **Buy Now**.

3.  Select a payment method, and click **Buy Now**.

    MaxCompute provides two payment options: Subscription and Pay-As-You-Go. You can select a method as needed. For more information, see [Billing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/74873.htm).

    You can select a region according to your current setup. We recommend that you take into consideration the regions of related Alibaba Cloud products \(such as ECS\) and your actual data.

4.  Confirm the order details and click **Activate**.

    After, you can create MaxCompute projects as needed. For more information, see [Create a project](/intl.en-US/Prepare/Create a project.md).

    **Note:** MaxCompute and DataWorks shares the same console. You must [activate DataWorks](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ide?spm=a3c0i.7911826.1097638.dnavproductsh3.3a5214b3O5YhZp) before you create a MaxCompute project.

# Connection to data tunnel service {#concept_u2v_4pg_vdb .concept}

In different network environments, you need to choose different service addresses \(Endpoints\) to connect services, otherwise you will not be able to initiate requests to services.

Both DataHub and Tunnel use different endpoints in different network environments. Depending on the network environment, select the appropriate service address or endpoint, to connect to the service. Select the appropriate address or endpoint for your network to be able to send requests to the service.

**Note:** 

Different network connections may affect your [Billing](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Computation pricing.md#).

For detailed endpoints information for different network environments, see [Endpoints and Data Centers](../../../../intl.en-US/Prepare/Configure endpoints.md#) Access Domains and Data Centers.
